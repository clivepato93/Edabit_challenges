Dear Sir or Madam,

I am thrilled to be applying for the role of Software Engineer at Evergreen Energy. It is clear to see that your company, is looking for somebody who has the right attitude, for a role that is aiming to reduce something what is a clear issue for today's planet, Carbon Footprint.

Any task I am given to do, I aim to complete each task to the best of my ability and I have real hunger to learn new skills when required.

After reviewing my resume I hope you can see I  am the self motivated applicant you are looking for, who can communicate well with other in a professional friendly demeanour.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,
Clive Toniato
